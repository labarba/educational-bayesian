# Contributing

**IMPORTANT**: this document has been adapted from the excellent Contributing
guide of the [UofTCoders' `rcourse`](https://github.com/UofTCoders/rcourse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This repository is an open-source crash course,
aimed to introduce and teach how to construct inverse problems in computational engineering.

## How to Contribute

Anyone can contribute to the course repository via [pull requests][pull-requests].

We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a [fork][fork-explanation] of this repository, and [clone][clone-explanation] it to your local computer.
2. In your local copy of this repository, create a new [branch][branch-explanation].
3. Commit your changes to that branch.
4. Push the edits on that branch to your fork on GitHub.
5. Submit a pull request to the master repository (`mbarzegary/educational-bayesian`).
6. If you receive feedback on your pull request,
make further commits to the new branch on your fork. These will automatically be added to
your pull request.

You may wish to look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][contribute]
for more detailed instructions. The [GitHub Glossary][glossary] is also a useful resource that explains
Git-related terminology.

You can also open an issue if you find a bug or have a suggestion regarding the provided content.

## Format

If you want to add a new module, please pay attention that it should be developed as a Jupyter notebook file (with `ipynb` extension). That's the format this course is built upon. You may have a look at the available sample(s) to have some ideas of how to structure your module.
